HOOKS : class features in functional component basically to work with state
They are of 4 types 

UseState: 
update the state 
can set the initial value of state

useEffect:
its a sideefect for means if we are changing the state  then we want some kind of sideeffect
example: there is a state variable "text" and when we are changing the state of text then if we want some kind of sideeffect
like alert (jab state change horaha ho tabhi alert krne k liy useeffect use hota hai)
just like componentdidUpdate in class based component

useContext: used for context api
when there are nested components then if we want to send some data to the bottom level component the it become difficult 
so we make a context that is available to every component equally
it gobally available to every components

useRef: return mutable reference object called current
It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
